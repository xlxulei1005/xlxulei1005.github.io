## Simple Introduction

I am currently a research engineer in ASAPP. My interest lies in applying Machine Learning/Deep Learning to solve practical questions. I used to do internship in AT&T Big Data department and I am now working in a 200 people startup focus on Natural Langage Processing(NLP) with leading researchers in this area.

I am a big fan of nature and I love hiking.

**Goal and Target**: I open this page to keep myself motivated and share. My target is writing at least one detailed article per month either about paper or the thing I learned.
